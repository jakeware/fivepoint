# Iterative 5-point Algorithm #

This repository contains a C++ implementation of an iterative 5-point algorithm for computing the relative pose between two images, given a putative set of point correspondences between the two images. More information regarding this work can be found in our BMVC 2013 paper. If you find the code useful, please cite:
